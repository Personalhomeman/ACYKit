## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

To use the pods, you need to install the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), the best way to install it is using [bundler](http://bundler.io). So run command in your command line:
```shell
$ cd YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT_DIR
$ gem install bundler
$ vim Gemfile
```
And add the following lines to Gemfile:
```ruby
source "https://gems.ruby-china.org/"
gem "cocoapods"
```
*  If you are NOT in China, the first line is NOT needed!

Save it, and run command:

```shell
$ bundle install
```
Now you can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).
